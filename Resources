âœ… What Youâ€™ve Used in Your Project
You can include the following list in your README.md file (your GitHub project description):

ðŸ“Œ Project Title
Admission Agent using IBM watsonx.ai (RAG with Vectorized Documents)

ðŸ§  Project Description
This AI-powered Admission Agent helps users get answers related to admission processes such as eligibility, required documents, application deadlines, and guidelines. It combines document-based retrieval with language generation using IBM watsonx.ai Studio tools.

ðŸš€ Features
Accepts user queries related to admission info.

Retrieves answers from uploaded documents (.txt, .pdf, etc.).

Provides helpful information using Granite LLM.

Built entirely on IBM watsonx.ai Agent Lab.

Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern.

Optimized for low-code development using Watson tools.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Tool / Service	Purpose
IBM Watsonx.ai	Main platform to build the agent
IBM Agent Lab	No-code/low-code interface to create the AI agent
Grounded generation (RAG)	Used for combining document retrieval + answer generation
Granite Language Model	LLM used to generate step-by-step admission help
Vectorized Document Indexing	For searching knowledge base files
.txt / .pdf files	Contained custom admission data uploaded via UI
Browser (Edge/Chrome)	For development & testing
